# Cannibals-and-missionaries
This a 3rd year Artificial intelligence project for Athens University of Economics and Business project (AUEB). The task is to implement the cannibals and missinaries
riddle using an A star search algorithm(meaning finding the proper heuristic function) with a closed set. The number of missinaries, the number of cannibals and the boat 
size are all parameters that can be given by the user. 
A generalized version of the problem
